# Sample Project

The sample is designed to showcase the Atoms in both a traditional UI and declarative UI.

## Android Sample

In the Android sample we have the `DesignScaffolding` and `TabBar` classes, which are some helper functions to display the UI in either Compose or XML.

Then each Element has both an XML and Composable class associated it for comparion.
