# Roadmap

Atomik handles a lot of different features of Atomic Design. To make it easier to track we have a roadmap below. Note that it's more of a to do list rather than a time structured list.

:::info

Design Systems generally contain at least three UI components that will be covered in Atomik: Color, Typography, and Iconography. 

Additional components include: Elevation, Spacing, and Accessibility.
