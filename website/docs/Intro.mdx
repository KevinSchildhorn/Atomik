Atomik is a Kotlin Multiplatform library that acts as an implementation of a design system in your shared code. It allows you to share design information in common code, and apply it to your UI with ease.

:::caution

Atomik is in an experimental early stage, and should be used for testing purposes only.

:::

### What is Atomic Design

First off, Atomik is based around Atomic Design. If you are unfamiliar with that concept please learn more [here](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

In short, atomic design is methodology for creating design systems, in which you create components that can be made up of sub-components, similarly to atoms and molecules.

> **For example**: a Search Bar Organism can contain a Button molecule and a Text Field atom together.

The first layer of components are known as atoms, and are generally a single UI element such as a Text View. Each atom contains color, typography and iconography data when applicable.

# Installation

The Atomik dependency is located in Maven Central, and should be added to your commonMain source set in your Kotlin Multiplatform module.

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.kevinschildhorn:atomik:X.Y.Z")
```

## Getting Started
:::note

As this library is evolving some logic may change.

:::

Atomik has a lot of components and can be hard to jump into. Documentation on each aspect can be found under [Core Concepts](./category/core-concepts).

**Components**:
* [Atoms](./core-concepts/atoms) - The building blocks of Atomik. Modular UI data that can be applied to UI elements
* [Molecules and beyond](./core-concepts/molecules) - A hierarchy of atom groups, each containing multiple of their respective subgroup
* [Design Systems](./core-concepts/design-systems.md) - A collection of Atoms, Colors, Typographies and Iconographies.

In addition to components, Atomik has specific shared UI details:
* [AtomikColor](./core-concepts/colors) - A common representation of Color, either with Hex or RGBA values
* [AtomikTypography](./core-concepts/typography) - A common representation of Typography, such as font, size, and weight.
* AtomikIconography - TBD

### Example

While it's recommended to read more of the core concepts first, here is a preview of what an `Atomik` design system looks like.
#### Atom
```kotlin
val color = AtomikColor(r = 100, g = 100, b = 100, a = null)

val sampleAtom = FigmaShapeAtom(
    constraintX = AtomikConstraintX.ALIGN_LEFT,
    constraintY = AtomikConstraintY.ALIGN_TOP,
    color = color,
)
```

#### Design System
```kotlin
val color = AtomikColor(r = 100, g = 100, b = 100, a = null)
val typography = AtomikTypography(size = 14)

val colorSet = DefaultColorSet(
    primary = color,
    ...
)

val typographySet = DefaultTypographySet(
    body = typography,
    ...
)

val designSystem = DefaultDesignSystem(
    colorSet = colorSet,
    typographySet = typographySet,
    components = mapOf("sample" to sampleAtom),
    fontFamily = null,
)
```

#### Platform Code

:::danger

These calls will be updated in the future to be more generalized
